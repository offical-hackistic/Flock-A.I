Flock A.I is an intelligent poultry farm management assistant built to help growers optimize conditions for raising the healthiest birds possible while improving farm efficiency.

This dashboard collects and displays key environmental and flock health metrics, including:

Temperature & Humidity – ensuring comfort and preventing stress.

Air Quality (CO₂ & NH₃ levels) – maintaining safe and breathable conditions.

Feed & Water Monitoring – preventing shortages and improving growth.

Bird Health Indicators – spotting early warning signs before they become critical.

The system provides:
✅ Real-time alerts when conditions leave safe ranges.
✅ Animated charts & counters for at-a-glance insights.
✅ Data-driven recommendations to help farmers take quick action.
✅ Future potential for predictive growth curves and historical trend analysis.

⚠️ Note: This version is a testing model and uses fake generated data for demonstration purposes only. In a real farm setting, Flock A.I would connect to live sensors and flock management systems to provide actionable insights that directly support better flock health, higher yields, and improved profitability.
